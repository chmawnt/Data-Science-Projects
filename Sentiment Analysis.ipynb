The notch design, hides the battery % and network speed, one has to pull down a bit to see these 2 things. Note 5 and 6pro both have a common issue-- after switching the swipe up (to unlock) does not work smoothly every time. The escape is to switch off the swipe up feature. After Note4, in the newer models the length of USB cable has become shorter, whichis a problem if you are little away from the plug point. How much cost does Xiaomi saves by shortening the cable? 6pro came with a smaller ejection tool, additional cost saving by cutting 2gm of metal. The front flash if Note5 has been removed in 6pro. These manufacturers seem to be idiots and fooling public by launching new models without any real additional feature or improvement. Anyway, its an OK phone for 10,000 (3GB/32GB).

Note 5 and 6pro both have a common issue-- after switching the swipe up (to unlock) does not work smoothly every time. The escape is to switch off the swipe up feature. After Note4, in the newer models the length of USB cable has become shorter, whichis a problem if you are little away from the plug point. How much cost does Xiaomi saves by shortening the cable? 6pro came with a smaller ejection tool, additional cost saving by cutting 2gm of metal. The front flash if Note5 has been removed in 6pro.
